<h3>KNN Algorithm :</h3>

<p>Logistic regression is a staK-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the K data points in the training set that are closest to a given input, and then making predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression) of these neighbors. It's a simple and effective algorithm, but it can be sensitive to the choice of K and the distance metric used.</p>

<p>On KNN it have the data's in an graph when an new data entered it check the nearest k data majority belongs to which group and put that data in that group.</p>

<p>Formula for Distance : d =  âˆš(( x2 - x1 )^2 + ( y2 - y1 )^2 )</p>
